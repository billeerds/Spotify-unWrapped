# Spotify unWrapped

This project aims to analyze my Spotify listening patterns and programmatically generate a new "Spotify Wrapped" experience using Generative AI. This last year's was lack luster and I'd like to make a fun, fresh feature. 

## Traditional EDA

This section focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand my listening habits.  It involves:

*   Data Extraction: Obtaining listening history data from Spotify (e.g., using the Spotify API).
*   Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
*   Descriptive Statistics: Calculating metrics like most played artists, songs, genres, listening time, etc.
*   Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visualize trends and insights (e.g., time series plots, bar charts).

## Leveraging LLMs

This section explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the Spotify Wrapped experience.  It includes:

*   Personalized Summaries: Generating creative summaries of listening habits using prompts tailored to the EDA results.
*   Genre/Artist Recommendations: Developing a GenAI-powered recommendation system based on listening history.
*   Playlist Generation: Creating unique playlists based on specific moods, genres, or time periods.
*   Interactive Storytelling: Building an interactive narrative around listening data, potentially using LLMs for dialogue or text generation.
